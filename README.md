# vX
 **vX** is a very basic version control system to understand the idea of event sourcing.

# How it works?
When a user commits a file for the first time, the system saves the whole file to disk. 
Subsequent commits, reflecting changes to that file, might save only the deltaâ€”that is, just the lines that were added, 
changed, or removed. Then, when the user checks out a certain version, the system opens the version-0 file 
and applies all subsequent deltas, in order, to derive the version the user asked for.
